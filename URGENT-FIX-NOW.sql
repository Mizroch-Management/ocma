-- URGENT FIX: Restore full access to organizations
-- Run this IMMEDIATELY in Supabase SQL Editor to restore access

-- Step 1: Completely disable RLS on all tables temporarily
-- This will allow you to access everything while we fix the policies
ALTER TABLE public.organizations DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.organization_members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.system_settings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

SELECT '✅ RLS DISABLED - You should now be able to access everything!' as message;

-- Step 2: Check what organizations exist
SELECT 'Existing organizations:' as status;
SELECT id, name, status, created_at FROM public.organizations;

-- Step 3: Check what memberships exist
SELECT 'Existing memberships:' as status;
SELECT om.*, o.name as org_name 
FROM public.organization_members om
LEFT JOIN public.organizations o ON om.organization_id = o.id;

-- Step 4: Check what settings exist
SELECT 'Existing settings:' as status;
SELECT id, setting_key, organization_id FROM public.system_settings;

-- IMPORTANT MESSAGE
SELECT '
===========================================
IMPORTANT: RLS is now DISABLED
===========================================
This means:
1. ✅ You can now access the Organizations page
2. ✅ You can create new organizations  
3. ✅ You can save Settings
4. ⚠️  BUT there is no security (temporary fix)

After confirming everything works:
1. Create your organization
2. Save your API keys in Settings
3. Test that everything works
4. Then we will re-enable RLS with proper policies

For now, your app should work completely!
