# AI Workflow Enhancement Plan

## ✅ Completed Improvements (August 11, 2024)

### 1. AI Workflow Accessibility ✅
- **Issue**: Only first section (business info) was accessible in existing workflows
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Removed step completion requirements for navigation

### 9. Step Selection on Workflow Resume ✅
- **Implementation**:
