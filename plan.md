# AI Workflow Enhancement Plan

## Completed Improvements ‚úÖ

### 1. AI Workflow Accessibility
- **Issue**: Only first section (business info) was accessible in existing workflows
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed step completion requirements for navigation
  - Added clickable progress dots for direct navigation
  - All sections now freely accessible and editable

### 2. Prompt Visibility and Editing
- **Feature**: Users can now see and edit AI prompts at each stage
- **Implementation**:
  - Added toggle buttons to show/hide AI prompts
  - Made prompts editable via textarea inputs
  - Prompts are used when regenerating content
  - Works in both review and approved states

### 3. Workflow Resume from Edited Section
- **Feature**: When a section is edited, workflow resumes from that point
- **Implementation**:
  - Editing an approved step invalidates all subsequent steps
  - Subsequent steps are reset to pending state
  - Workflow automatically continues from edited section
  - Ensures logical flow and dependency management

### 4. Data Persistence
- **Already Implemented**: Robust data persistence system
- **Features**:
  - Auto-save with 2-second debouncing
  - Dual-layer persistence (database + local storage)
  - Organization-scoped workflows
  - Complete audit trail of all changes

### 5. Strategy Linking
- **Issue**: Strategy from workflow wasn't linking to Strategy page
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed disconnected callbacks in workflow-step-renderer
  - Connected onStrategyApproved to dispatch SET_APPROVED_STRATEGY
  - Strategy now properly appears in Strategy page

### 6. File Upload - AI Workflow
- **Implementation**:
  - Created reusable FileUpload component with drag-and-drop
  - Added to Business Info Collector (Step 5)
  - Supports images, PDFs, documents, presentations
  - Files stored in Supabase Storage
  - Compact mode for inline display
