# URGENT: Vercel Configuration Required

## ⚠️ Action Required in Vercel Dashboard

The app is deployed but needs environment variables configured.

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables

Go to: https://vercel.com/eli-mizrochs-projects/ocma/settings/environment-variables

Add these 3 variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL = https://wxxjbkqnvpbjywejfrox.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Ind4eGpia3FudnBianl3ZWpmcm94Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTMxNzQ1NDcsImV4cCI6MjA2ODc1MDU0N30.p_yTKoOkIScmsaXWj2IBs8rsr5lCcKmNzBdYdW9Hfb4
VITE_APP_OWNER_EMAIL = elimizroch@gmail.com
```

### Step 2: Trigger Redeploy

After adding variables:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/eli-mizrochs-projects/ocma
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click "..." menu → "Redeploy"
4. Select "Use existing Build Cache" = OFF
5. Click "Redeploy"

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Check these URLs:
- Production: https://ocma.dev
- Preview: https://ocma-git-main-eli-mizrochs-projects.vercel.app

### What to Expect

Once configured, you'll see:
- OCMA branded login page
- AI-powered content creation tools
- Social media management dashboard
- Analytics and reporting features

### Current Status

✅ Code deployed and building successfully
✅ Fallback credentials added for build process
⚠️ Environment variables need to be added in Vercel
⏳ Waiting for redeploy with proper configuration

---

**Note**: The app has fallback values so it will build, but full functionality requires the environment variables to be set in Vercel.
