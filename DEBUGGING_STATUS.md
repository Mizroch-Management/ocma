# OCMA TDZ Error Debugging Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-09 (Auto-updating)

## Current Issue
**Error:** "Cannot access 'a' before initialization" (Temporal Dead Zone error)
- **Occurs:** Only for user account `elimizroch@gmail.com` (has 4 organizations)
- **Does NOT occur:** For new accounts with 0 organizations
- **Location:** Production site https://ocma.dev

## What's Been Fixed ✅
1. ✅ Critical parsing errors in multiple files
2. ✅ Environment configuration (.env.local)
3. ✅ Edge functions deployed to Supabase
4. ✅ Strategies table created in database
5. ✅ Removed lazy loading from Dashboard component
6. ✅ Added context initialization guards in Index.tsx
7. ✅ Removed circular dependency between Strategy and Workflow contexts
8. ✅ Removed unused lazy Dashboard import from App.tsx
9. ✅ Temporarily removed WorkflowProvider (error persists without it)

## Current Hypothesis
The error is NOT in WorkflowProvider. It's likely in:
- **StrategyProvider** (next to test)
- **OrganizationProvider** initialization
- **Dashboard component** when rendering with multiple organizations
- Some interaction between these components specific to multi-org accounts

## Debugging Strategy
Systematic isolation by removing providers one at a time:
1. ✅ Removed WorkflowProvider → Error persists
2. ⏳ Next: Remove StrategyProvider
3. ⏳ Next: Simplify OrganizationProvider
4. ⏳ Next: Simplify Dashboard component

## Latest Deployment
- **Commit:** e8af25c
- **Deployed:** ~2 minutes ago
- **Status:** Error still present
- **URL:** https://ocma.dev/?test=e8af25c

## Test Results Log

### Test 1 - Removed WorkflowProvider
- **Time:** Just completed
- **Result:** ❌ Error still occurs
- **Conclusion:** WorkflowProvider is NOT the source

### Test 2 - Remove StrategyProvider  
- **Time:** Just completed
- **Result:** ❌ Error still occurs
- **Conclusion:** StrategyProvider is NOT the source

### Critical Finding
**The error occurs with ONLY these providers active:**
- AuthProvider
- OrganizationProvider  
- TooltipProvider
- BrowserRouter

This means the issue is in:
1. OrganizationProvider initialization logic
2. Dashboard component rendering logic
3. ResponsiveLayout component

### Test 3 - Checking Dashboard Component (In Progress)
- **Status:** Analyzing now...
