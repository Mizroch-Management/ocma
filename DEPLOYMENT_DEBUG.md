# Deployment Debug Information

## Issue
The site at https://ocma.dev is showing "bloom-ai-marketing-suite" instead of "OCMA" branding.

## Repository Check
- Local repository: https://github.com/Mizroch-Management/ocma.git
- Latest commits pushed successfully
- OCMA branding is in the source code

## Possible Causes

### 1. Wrong Repository Connected in Vercel
**Check:** Go to https://vercel.com/eli-mizrochs-projects/ocma/settings/git
- Verify the connected repository is: `Mizroch-Management/ocma`
- If it shows a different repository (like one with "bloom" in the name), you need to:
  1. Disconnect the current repository
  2. Connect to `Mizroch-Management/ocma`
  3. Redeploy

### 2. Wrong Branch Deployed
**Check:** Verify the production branch in Vercel settings
- Should be deploying from `main` branch
- Our code is on the `main` branch

### 3. Build Cache Issue
**Solution:** Force clear cache and rebuild:
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Go to "Advanced" tab
3. Click "Delete Build Cache"
4. Trigger a new deployment

### 4. Different Project
The domain ocma.dev might be pointing to a different Vercel project.
**Check:** 
- Go to https://vercel.com/eli-mizrochs-projects
- Look for any project with "bloom" in the name
- Check which project has ocma.dev domain assigned

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Verify Project Connection:**
   ```
   https://vercel.com/eli-mizrochs-projects/ocma/settings/git
   ```
   Should show: Mizroch-Management/ocma

2. **Check Domain Assignment:**
   ```
   https://vercel.com/eli-mizrochs-projects/ocma/settings/domains
   ```
   Should show: ocma.dev

3. **Force Rebuild:**
   - Delete build cache
   - Redeploy from main branch

4. **If Wrong Project:**
   - Find the project with "bloom" name
   - Remove ocma.dev domain from it
   - Add ocma.dev domain to the OCMA project

## Current Code Status
✅ OCMA branding in source code
✅ All features implemented
✅ Code pushed to GitHub
✅ Build works locally

## What Should Display
After correct deployment, the site should show:
- Title: "OCMA - AI-Powered Social Media Management"
- Login page with OCMA branding
- Full feature set from all 10 phases
